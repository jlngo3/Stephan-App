        <h1> Happy 2 Year Anniversary </h1>
        <p> Let's test your knowledge and see if you have been paying attention!</p>
        <p> Guidelines:
            <br>1. There are 30 questions. Once you are done, you can restart and play again. Fair warning, I did not code what happens once you finish so you can just close out of the page.
            <br>2. Do NOT cheat! Meaning don't look at your phone, computer and don't ask people around you.
            <br>3. Do NOT look at the script.js file because the answers are in there!!!
            <br>4. I am still new to coding so please don't judge. I did my best.
            <br>5. I love you!
