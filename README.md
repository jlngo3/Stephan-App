# Stephan-App

Happy 2 Year Anniversary!

I wanted to show you my appreciation by creating this webapp. It took me a long time to build it.
It's a pretty simple app but you do need to set it up onto your own computer since I don't have money to buy a web server. 
So just follow the step by step guide down below and let me know if you have any questions!

<br>STEP BY STEP GUIDE</br>
<br> 1. Download VSCODE. If you have it downloaded already then please proceed to step 2. </br>
<br> . . . (a) Copy and paste this link [ https://code.visualstudio.com/Download ]. This link will direct you to the Visual Studio Website. 
Just simply download the correct version you need for your computer and follow the instructions provided on the website for installtion.
Once you have VSCODE installed, run the program. </br>
<br> 2. Clone the repository. There are 2 ways you can do this, pick from one below. </br>
<br> . . . (a) Open VSCODE and click on the "Extensions" tab that is displayed on the LEFT column. It should be the one with 4 squares. 
You are going to search for "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and install that extension. Once this is installed, click on the "Explorer" tab that is found on the left column and click on "Clone Repository". It should ask you to log into your GitHub account. 
Once you are logged in, all you have to do is copy and paste the repo link that I had provided for you in the email or copy this link [ https://github.com/jlngo3/Stephan-App.git ]. And then click "Clone from GitHub". You might have to find a place to save this folder. 
Then everything should download properly onto your computer.</br>
<br> . . . (b) Use GitHub desktop application. Download the desktop application from this link [ https://desktop.github.com/ ]. Once you have it installed, make sure its connected to your GitHub account by simply logging in.
Next, on the top left corner, click on File > Clone repository > URL. Copy and paste the link I have provided to my GitHub. Select a place on your computer to store it. Click on "Clone" and you should be able to access it from VSCODE. If you don't see it on VSCODE, the you need to select File > Open Folder... and look for the place where you had stored the folder. </br>
<br> 3. On VSCODE, once the files are downloaded, you should see 3 files: index.html, script.js, and styles.css. Right click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server". A webpage should open up and BAM! you should see the webapp I made for you.

<br> Enjoy!
